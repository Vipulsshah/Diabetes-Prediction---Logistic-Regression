# Diabetes-Prediction---Logistic-Regression
# Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

# Content
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Solution:
Preprocessed the data by removing outliers and missing values.
Done Engineering by scaling the inputs with the help of StanderdScaler and doing train_test split.
Solved the problem using Logistic regression with thetrain accuracy of 82% and test accuracy of 81%
